## Project rules

- Homepage sections live as separate components in `src/components/home/` and are composed in `src/routes/index.tsx`, so the structure maps one-to-one onto WordPress/Elementor sections later.
- Brand colors, radius (16px) and the Manrope font live as tokens in `src/styles.css`; components never hardcode color values.
